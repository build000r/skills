# Copywriting Formulas

Copy frameworks for PSEO pages, video scripts, and social posts.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity > cleverness** - If you must choose, choose clear
2. **Benefits > features** - What it means for them, not what it does
3. **Specific > vague** - "15 minutes" beats "save time"
4. **Customer language** - Use words they use
5. **One idea per section** - Build logical flow

## CTA Formulas

## PSEO Page Copy Structure

## Social Post Copy

### Hook (first line)

The first line determines if anyone reads the rest.

```
[Contrarian statement]

"Why do Monday mornings feel like this?"

[Pattern interrupt]

```
Here's what I learned:

1. [Point] - [brief explanation]
2. [Point] - [brief explanation]
3. [Point] - [brief explanation]
```

**Story format**:
```
[Setup - past state]
[Turning point]
[Outcome - current state]
[Lesson]
```

**Framework format**:
```
The [Name] Framework:

[Step 1]: [What to do]
[Step 2]: [What to do]
[Step 3]: [What to do]

```

### CTA (last line)

```
[Engagement prompt]
"What would you add?"
"Agree or disagree?"
"Save this for later."
"Follow for more [topic]."
```

## Video Script Copy

### Hook Copy (0-3 seconds)

"Stop scrolling if you [relatable situation]"
```

### Transition Phrases

```
"Here's the thing..."
"But here's what most people miss..."

## Writing Quality Checklist

Before publishing any copy:

- [ ] **Simple words** - "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
- [ ] **Active voice** - "We built" not "It was built"
- [ ] **No weasel words** - Remove "very", "really", "quite"
- [ ] **Specific numbers** - "37% faster" not "much faster"
- [ ] **No exclamation points** - Let the content be exciting
- [ ] **Read aloud** - Does it sound natural?

## Copy by Awareness Level

Match copy intensity to where they are:

### Unaware
- Lead with problem/symptom
- Don't mention solution yet
- "Are you [experiencing symptom]?"

### Problem-Aware
- Name the problem
- Agitate the pain
- "The real cost of [problem]..."

### Solution-Aware
- Introduce your category
- Differentiate approach
- "Unlike [alternatives], we..."

### Product-Aware
- Specific benefits
- Proof and credibility
- "[Number] teams use us because..."

### Most Aware
- Direct offer
- Remove friction
- "Start free. No credit card."

---

## Natural Transitions

Avoid robotic section breaks:

### From problem to solution
```
❌ "Now let's talk about the solution."
✅ "Here's what changed everything."
```

### From feature to benefit
```
❌ "This feature helps with X."
✅ "Which means you can finally X."
```

### From point to point
```
❌ "Another thing is..."
✅ "Even better:"
```

### From content to CTA
```
❌ "Click below to sign up."
✅ "Ready to [outcome]? Here's how to start."
```
